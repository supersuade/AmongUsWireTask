# AmongUsWireTask

This is an arduino project using platform.io to create a wire task puzzle from the video game Among Us. 
Connect 4 wires to 4 pins matching colors, and the game will reset.

Made for my son's 6th birthday party in 2021. Happy Birthday! Excuse the poor code, I wrote it in a day :)
